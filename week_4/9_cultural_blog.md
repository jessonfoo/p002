First, create a new HTML file for your this post in your [USERNAME].github.io website. Create a new HTML file and use the date to name it `week4_cultural_blog.html`. Copy the Code from your `blog_template`. 

## Release 1: 
Remember the [compass of shame](http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf)? Oftentimes when we have a conflict with someone we use one of our strategies for dealing with shame. 

Conduct some research on strategies for identifying the sources for conflict then discuss a time you had a conflict in your life. Identify the reason you had the conflict and whether your actions made it better or worse. 

Once you've opened your file, write a response to each exercise using the HTML you've learned to set up the file: 

1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened? 
2. What was the source of the conflict?
3. How did you handle that conflict? 
4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?
5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?
6. What did you learn from this experience?
