# U2.W6: Create a PezDispenser Class from User Stories 
**[SOLO CHALLENGE](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) OPTION 1**


## Learning Objectives
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Translate a user story into driver code and solutions
- Translate driver test code into a class structure using object-oriented design

## Background
In this challenge, you will translate user stories into an Ruby object (using a class). If you aren't sure what a user story is, use the power of google to do some research. Also make sure to practice using your new `assert` knowledge!

## Directions
 
1. Review the User Stories: 
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to "create" a new pez dispenser with a group of flavors that represent pez so it's easy to start with a full pez dispenser.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to easily count the number of pez remaining in a dispenser so I can know how many are left.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to take a pez from the dispenser so I can eat it.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to add a pez to the dispenser so I can save a flavor for later.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to see all the flavors inside the dispenser so I know the order of the flavors coming up.
2. Review the [Driver Code](../../references/driver_code.md) (These aren't expectations) Add assert statements (remember to define the `assert` method!) to make sure it's working properly.
3. We definitely know we have a PezDispenser class, but what are it's innards? What are PezDispenser's attribute(s) and method(s)? Take a moment to list out all the methods as[Pseudocode](../../references/pseudocode.md), and show the input and output. It's good to be clear when there isn't an input or output!
4. Translate your pseudocode into your [Initial Solution](../../references/initial_solution.md) Make sure your test code still works and satisfies the expected output. 
5. [Refactor](../../references/refactoring.md) your initial solution.
6. [Reflect](../../references/reflection_guidelines.md)
7. Sync your changes (push your solution) to Github
8. [Review](../../references/review.md)
