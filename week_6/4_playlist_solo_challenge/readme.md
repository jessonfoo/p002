# U2.W6: Create a Playlist from Driver Code 
**[SOLO CHALLENGE](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) OPTION 2**


## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Translate a user story into driver code and solutions
- Translate driver test code into a class structure using object-oriented design

## Summary
Review the Driver Code included in the [solution](my_solution.rb) file and consider the following:

- What are the methods you need?
- Where do those methods belong?
- What should those methods do?
- How can you model real-world behavior through code?

User Error-Driven Development (EDD) to solve the challenge. To do this you will need to run the code, find the error and write code that fixes that error. Repeat for each error you find. You shouldn't go into too much detail for each method until you've solved each error.

After you've fixed each error, you should have fun filling in each of the methods -- but don't forget to go through the normal steps in your coding revelry!

## Release 0: Review the [Driver Test Code](../../references/driver_code.md) 
Convert as many of the driver code examples into driver test code based on the way you want to implement each method.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](../../references/pseudocode.md)

## Release 2: Write your [Initial Solution](../../references/initial_solution.md)

## Release 3: [Refactored](../../references/refactoring.md)

## Release 4: [Reflect](../../references/reflection_guidelines.md)

## Release 5: Push your solution to GitHub
