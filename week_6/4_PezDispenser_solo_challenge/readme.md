# U2.W6: Create a PezDispenser Class from User Stories 
**[SOLO CHALLENGE](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/solo_challenges.md) OPTION 1**


## Learning Competencies
- Implement a basic Ruby class and identify when to use instance variables
- Translate a user story into driver test code and solutions
- Translate driver test code into a class structure using object-oriented design

## Summary
In this challenge, you will translate user stories into an Ruby object (using a class). If you aren't sure what a user story is, use the power of google to do some research. Also make sure to practice using your new `assert` knowledge!

## Release 0: Review the User Stories: 
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to "create" a new pez dispenser with a group of flavors that represent pez so it's easy to start with a full pez dispenser.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to easily count the number of pez remaining in a dispenser so I can know how many are left.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to take a pez from the dispenser so I can eat it.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to add a pez to the dispenser so I can save a flavor for later.
  - As a pez user, I'd like to be able to see all the flavors inside the dispenser so I know the order of the flavors coming up.

## Release 1: Review the [Driver Code](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/driver_code.md)
These do not have expectations that would return `true` or `false` if called.  Add assert statements (remember to define the `assert` method!) to make sure it's working properly.

## Release 2: [Pseudocode](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/pseudocode.md)
We definitely know we have a PezDispenser class, but what are it's innards? What are PezDispenser's attribute(s) and method(s)? Take a moment to list out all the methods, and show the input and output. It's good to be clear when there isn't an input or output!

## Release 3: Write your [Initial Solution](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/initial_solution.md) 
Make sure your test code still works and satisfies the expected output. 

## Release 4: [Refactor](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/refactoring.md)

## Release 5: [Reflect](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/reflection_guidelines.md)

## Release 6: Push your solution to Github

## Release 7: [Review](https://github.com/Devbootcamp/phase_0_handbook/blob/master/coding_references/review.md)
Write feedback for at least two other solutions!
