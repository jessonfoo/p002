# U2.W4: Calculate the Mode


## Learning Competencies
- Use Tests to guide development
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Determine which data structure (arrays or hashes) to use based on challenge requirements
- Use strings, integers, arrays, and/or hashes


## Summary:

Write a method `mode` which takes an `Array` of numbers or strings as its input and returns an `Array` of the most frequent values.

If there's only one most-frequent value, it returns a single-element `Array`.

For example,

```ruby
mode([1,2,3,3])         # => [3]
mode([4.5, 0, 0])       # => [0]
mode([1.5, -1, 1, 1.5]) # => [1.5]
mode([1,1,2,2])         # => [1,2]
mode([1,2,3])           # => [1,2,3], because all occur with equal frequency
mode(["who", "what", "where", "who"]) # => "who"
```


## Release 0:. Run the tests
In your terminal, make sure you are in the [hard_find_mode](./) directory. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec mode_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](../../../references/refactoring.md) *commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](../../../references/reflection_guidelines.md) 
Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution` file. Use the [reflection guidelines](../../../reflection_guidelines.md) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Sync your repo with GitHub
When you feel confident with your solution, sync your changes through the GitHub desktop app with your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).
