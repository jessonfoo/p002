# U2.W4: Add it up!


## Learning Competencies
- Use Tests to guide development
- Break down problems into implementable pseudocode
- Iterate through data structures and manipulate the content
- Find and use built-in Ruby methods to solve challenges
- Use if/else statements, string methods, while/until loops, Enumerable#each methods


## Summary
Write a method `total` which takes an `Array` of numbers as its input and returns their total (sum).

For example,

```ruby
total([1,2,3])      # => 6
total([4.5, 0, -1]) # => 3.5
total([-100, 100])  # => 0
```

Then, write another method `sentence_maker` which takes an `Array` of strings or numbers and returns 
each element joined into a sentence. 
*Note: The first letter should be capitalized and the sentence should end with a period.*

```ruby
sentence_maker(["i", "want", "to", "go", "to", "the", "movies"]) 
# => "I want to go to the movies."
```

**Commit your changes after each release (except for Release 0)!**

## Release 0:. Run the tests
In your terminal, navigate to the directory that corresponds to this challenge in your forked 
`p0_unit1_submission` repo. Type `rspec` followed by the spec file name. ex. `rspec array_total_spec.rb`
Each test should fail. Read the output in your terminal to see what is making the tests fail.

## Release 1: [Pseudocode](../../../references/pseudocode.md) *commit your changes*

## Release 2: [Initial Solution](../../../references/initial_solution.md) *commit your changes*

## Release 3: [Refactored Solution](../../../references/refactoring.md) *commit your changes*

## Release 4:  [Reflect](../../../references/reflection_guidelines.md) 
Include your reflection in the appropriate section in your `my_solution` file. Use the [reflection guidelines](../../../reflection_guidelines.md) to guide your reflection. ***NOTE: Reflections are mandatory!*** Commit your changes!

## Release 5: Sync your repo with GitHub
When you feel confident with your solution, sync your changes through the GitHub desktop app with your repo on GitHub. 
If you have done this successfully, you should be able to see your new code on your repo on [github.com](https://github.com).

## Release 6: [Review](../../../references/review.md)
