# U2.W4: Add it up!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

# What is the input?
# The input is Arr
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?)
# the output should return the total of Arr
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# I will define the function total to take in Array and return x


# 2. Initial Solution
def total(arr)
	x = 0
	@array = arr
	for i in @array
		x += @array[i]
	end
	return x
end

# 3. Refactored Solution
