# Week 6: Object Oriented Design in Ruby

Last week you started creating your own objects in Ruby. This week you will be working with something called Object-Oriented Design. There is a great resource called [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby (book)](http://www.poodr.com/) (affectionately pronounced "Poo-Dur"). There isn't a free copy online, so use the mighty power of google (and the free book preview on Amazon) to introduce yourself to the fundamentals of object-oriented design.

Don't forget your Unit Goals (listed below)! 

## Challenges

1. [Testing with Assert Statements](1_assert_statements)
2. [Drawer Debugger](2_drawer_debugger)
3. [Creating a BoggleBoard Class](3_BoggleBoard)
4. [Creating a PezDispenser Class - SOLO CHALLENGE](4_PezDispenser_solo_challenge) **or** [Create a Playlist from Driver Code - SOLO CHALLENGE](4_playlist_solo_challenge)
5. [Refactoring for Code Readability](5_refactoring)
6. [Technical Blog](6_technical_blog.md) 
7. [Cultural Blog](7_cultural_blog.md)
8. [BONUS Creating a Car Class from User Stories](8_BONUS_CarClass)


## Submitting your work
Sync changes from the master repo by following the steps [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client). Make sure you follow them step by step. If you experience problems, please attend office hours. It's difficult to diagnose problems relating to git and github via email. In the meantime, you can create the necessary files from the web version and copy the content. 

- If you are doing this from the Github Desktop App, follow [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client
)
directions. 
- If you are doing it from the command line, follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) directions.

Open your local version of the directory in Sublime. Make your changes and commit/sync as you complete challenges.

Make sure to include specific commit messages and sync your changes each time you complete a challenge.

You need to submit your work through a google form (TBD) by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit the links from your repo for each challenge above. 

### Remember your Unit Goals!
- Pair at least once this week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair 4 times on your own this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*
