## Learning Competencies
- Research a public ruby method and identify a scenario it could be used in
- Explain how to use an existing ruby method
<br> **OR**
- Compare different programming concepts
- Explain a methodology for deciding which data structure/ loop/ or language to use in a particular scenario


## Release 0: New file
Copy your blog tempate into a new HTML file named `week4_technical.html`. 


## Release 1: Research a Topic
### Option 1: Teach about Enumerable Methods
Select one of the ruby methods below, do some research on it, and think of a scenario that could teach how to use this method. Then write a blog that explains how it works (and what it works on) using that scenario. Be sure to include samples of code in your blog! It's good for people to see what you are talking about. 

#### Topics
- `Enumerable#map`
- `Enumerable#group_by`
- `Enumerable#cycle`

### Option 2: Research Questions
Research one of the following questions/topics. In your blog post, you will want to explain the background and teach others how to implement what you've learned. 

- Arrays vs. Hashes. What are they? What are they good for? How do you know which one to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
- Looping - Discuss the various ways to loop in Ruby. How can you decide which is best to use? (Teach others a strategy for deciding)
- Ruby vs. JavaScript - Discuss the benefits/drawbacks of each as you've experienced them. Explain to others how to decide which is better to use for what. 
  Also include examples of how to do the same thing in each. 

If you want to go more in-depth with any of these research memory use and link it to your strategy for deciding which to use. 

Write this blog for an audience of newb programmers.
